# Final Year Project - Personal Data Manager 📝
## What is it?
This proof of concept data manager aims to make data subjects better data controllers by allowing them to make GDPR requests from a central location. 
The applciaiton also servers as decentralised data store so that users can track their data on a device that they own and control instead of relying 
on companies like lastpass to do this for them.
